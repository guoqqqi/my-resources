### 我的今天学习进度
1. Today I have read the umi plug-in part (the ones used in the project) although I can't keep it in mind, but I can understand the use of each plug-in, and the details of how to implement it have not been deducted.
    The process of seeing is really blank. Looking at the back and flipping the front, I always remember some good and useful knowledge. I took a lot of notes, and here are a few notes that I always forget: 1. The directory test file with $ (double vertical bar) prefix is dynamic routing, and the suffix with $ (double vertical bar) is optional Dynamic routing.
2. I found that the files in each directory are very neat, almost all of the same file type, so I checked the type and interface in typing, as well as the function of declare.
3. Check the function of cookie and localStorage.

### summary
1. I looked at a blank face before, yesterday with the help of Master Ju, I switched to the 2.0 branch and looked directly at the files under the web. This is much more convenient! In the evening, I asked Boss Sun some questions. After explaining, I found that I understood a lot. I was not as confused as before. Forced to continue a wave of life, more energetic! Keep going tomorrow!
